  <p>In a farming game, you can buy certain animals for a specific price. As a player, you want to buy the most useful (i.e. the most expensive) animal. Here are the animals and their prices:</p> 
  <p><strong>Item: Price</strong></p> 
  <p>Chicken: 23</p> 
  <p>Goat: 678</p> 
  <p>Pig: 1296</p> 
  <p>Cow: 3848</p> 
  <p>Sheep: 6769</p> 
  <p>Write a program that determines what is <strong>the most expensive animal</strong> that the user can buy with their money and <strong>how many of them</strong> they can buy.<strong> </strong></p> 
  <p>Note that you should only find <strong>one </strong>kind of animal to buy (the most expensive). You don't need to mention the alternative options.</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The money that the user has.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>How many animals the user can afford, for example, <strong>20 chickens</strong>. If the user cannot afford any animal, write <strong>None. </strong></p>
